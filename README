A form helper for CakePHP.

This helper simply wraps all form input fields (and all other calls) with LI.

To use it, simply add it to your app/views/helpers folder and add it to the list
of helpers in your controller:

    var $helpers = array('UlForm');

To create a form with the helper, simply write:

    <?php echo $this->UlForm->create(); ?>

To add close the form again, just call:

    <?php echo $this->UlForm->end();

You can use all the existing functions from the core form helper.
See the CakePHP's cookbook for examples on how to use the form helper:
